If the script must be run as **`sudo`**, and you're calling it from a Flask API, there are several **important implications and safe handling options** to consider.

---

## ðŸš¨ Key Security Warning

Running anything via `sudo` from a web server is **extremely risky**. It can easily become a vector for privilege escalation if not strictly controlled. Avoid unless absolutely necessary.

---

## âœ… Options to Handle `sudo` Safely

### ðŸ”¹ **Option 1: Use `sudo` with No Password (Restricted Command Only)**

**Step 1: Allow the web server user (e.g., `www-data` or your shell user) to run the script without password**

Edit sudoers with:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add:

```bash
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /absolute/path/to/run_cert_scan_pipeline.sh
```

> Replace `www-data` with the user running your Flask app (maybe your login user or `flaskapp` if in a virtualenv)

---

**Step 2: Update `subprocess` call in Flask**

```python
result = subprocess.run(
    ["sudo", SCRIPT_PATH, subnet, "-p", ports, "-o", output],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    check=True
)
```

This allows only that specific script to be run as `sudo`, without password prompt.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Option 2: Use a Root-Owned Cronjob or Background Task**

If your script needs `sudo` because it runs tools like `zmap`, a safer model is:

* Let Flask queue a job (e.g., write a config file or message)
* A background process or cronjob running as root picks up the job and executes it

This avoids exposing `sudo` execution directly to the HTTP layer.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Option 3: Run Flask App with Elevated Capabilities (e.g., setcap on zmap)**

You can give tools like `zmap` the necessary privileges without using `sudo`, e.g.:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which zmap)
```

Now `zmap` can run without needing root.

---

## âœ… Recommended Setup

If your script only needs `sudo` to run `zmap`, the **safest** approach is:

1. Use `setcap` on `zmap` â†’ avoid needing root
2. Run the Flask API as a non-root user
3. Avoid allowing `sudo` from web-facing code unless fully sandboxed and validated

---

Would you like help configuring one of these options (e.g., writing the `sudoers` entry, background job model, or using `setcap`)?
